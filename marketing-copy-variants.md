# Landing Page Copy Variants (Hormozi Framework)

This document contains several variations of the hero section copy for the BrandGuard landing page, generated based on Alex Hormozi's value equation principles. These are intended for future A/B testing to optimize conversion rates as we generate traffic.

The initial implementation uses the "Fear of Fines" variant as it most directly addresses the primary "hair on fire" problem identified in market analysis.
