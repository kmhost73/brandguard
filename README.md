### ðŸš€ Go-to-Market Plan & Sales Automation

This is the automated sales and marketing plan to achieve our goal of **$1,000/day**. Your task is to execute this plan once the application is live.

#### **Phase 1: Secure First 10 Paying Customers (Target: 1 Week)**

**Objective:** Validate the product and pricing with real revenue.

**Action:**
1.  **Identify 50 prospects:** Find 50 Social Media Managers, Marketing Agency Owners, or D2C Brand Founders on LinkedIn.
2.  **Send Connection Request & Direct Message:** Use the following template.

> **Subject:** Quick question about influencer compliance
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I saw you work at [Company]. I run BrandGuard, a tool that uses AI to automate the tedious process of checking influencer posts for FTC compliance and brand safety before they go live.
>
> Our clients are saving 10-20 hours a month of manual work.
>
> Would you be open to a quick 15-minute demo next week to see if it could help your team?
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

#### **Phase 2: Scale to 612 Customers (Target: 1-2 Months)**

**Objective:** Reach the $30,000/month ($1,000/day) revenue target.

**Action:**
1.  **Content Marketing:** Publish one blog post per week on topics like "The Ultimate FTC Disclosure Guide for 2024" or "How to Avoid Influencer Marketing Disasters." This will be our SEO engine.
2.  **Viral Loop:** The "Share Report" feature is our primary growth driver. Every time a user shares a report, it's a sales pitch for our product.
3.  **Targeted Ads:** Run LinkedIn ads targeting users with the job title "Social Media Manager" or "Account Manager" at marketing agencies. Use the successful messaging from Phase 1.

This plan is data-driven, focused, and designed for rapid execution.
