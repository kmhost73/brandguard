# BrandGuard: The Greenlight Engine

**Our Mission: To make manual pre-publication review unthinkable.**

BrandGuard is the velocity machine for modern marketing teams. We are focused on eliminating "The Time Thief"—the hesitation, bureaucracy, and fear that kills momentum and surrenders the market to faster competitors. We replace endless review cycles with a single, authoritative action: **The Greenlight.**
